          Dear Mom and Dad,

Happy Anniversary! Watching the two of you over the years has shown me what true love, commitment, and partnership look like. Your bond is an inspirationâ€”built on patience, laughter, support, and so much love. I'm endlessly grateful to have grown up in a home filled with warmth and kindness because of the love you share.

Thank you for being my role models, not just as individuals, but as a couple. Here's to many more beautiful years together. You both deserve all the happiness in the world.
